# fp-js-workshop

> real world fp

I wanna share some functional programming knowledge,
more specially bundling (not really, but close).

I will try to cover some fp topics, like:
* why does it mean "functional"
* pureness, side-effects
* what is currying
* what is composition
* a bit of lenses

What im not going to tell you about
* monads, functors, applicative functors, category theory—nope, not even once

This is intended to be workshop series to describe all of that. To make sure
that anything mentioned before make sense, we all will implement real world js tool
which can be used to build bundlers like browserify or rollup.

## Talks

1. [Theoretic intro](https://iamstarkov.com/fp-js-workshop/01-theoretic-intro/#2)
2. Practical intro (upcoming)
3. Start implementation of real world modules. Several of them, smth about 6 sessions.
